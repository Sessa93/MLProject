\begin{abstract}
  The project aims to study the problem of dimensionality reduction in the field of astronomy.
  The high number of features involved often makes the job of classifying celestial objects, 
  basing entirely on their spectra, very difficult. The problem of preprocessing high dimensional 
  astronomical data is considered. We refer to the method described in \cite{redshift} to 
  overcome the problem of missing data and the different redshift factor of different object.
  The resulting dataset(which is the starting point for the project) contains information of
  4000 celestial object(such as galaxies, quasars, stars, etc.) each of the samples consists
  of 1000 attributes which describe the electromagnetic radiation over different wavelength(3000 to 8000 angstrom).
  We propose different methodologies to approach the problem of features reduction:
  PCA, Kernel PCA(different kernel are considered) and forward/backward features selection;
  The goodness of each method is evaluated over Support Vector Machine(soft margin penalty is tuned by 5-Fold cross-validation)
  considering as metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
  Final results shows, in general, how a very small number of features in the can actually capture an high percentage(90 \%)
  of the variance associated with the data.

\section{Introduction}
  Modern astronomy is concerned with the study of very distant celestial objects ie quasars, galaxies, stars, etc.\newline
  Often this type of classification is performed by analyzing the spectrum emitted by such objects.\newline
  In general the emission spectrum of a chemical element or of a chemical compound is defined as the electromagnetic radiation emitted
  when an atom or a molecule, of the object that we are observing, perform a transition from an high energy states to a low energy state.
  During the decadiment the atom or molecule the electromagnetic is irradiated under the form of photon, the associated photon energy
  (also called flux) is proportional is equal to the energy difference between the two energy states involved in the decadiment.\newline
  The important element is that for a given atom there are many possible electron transition, and each of these transition has a specific
  flux associated.\newline
  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey(henceforth referred as SDSS) is a major imaging and spectroscopic survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle
  optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States.\newline
  The collection of data started in 2000 and continues up to nowadays(latest data release in June 2013). The dataset comprises almost
  2 millions of spectra coming from different objects.\newline
  Machine learning plays an important role in the task of classifying these objects, given the fact that many times samples include
  more than 1000 features.\newline
  Features in general includes information about the flux associated with a specific wavelength.

  If the input feature vectors have very high dimension, the learning problem can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features.
  This is because the many "extra" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance.
  Hence the problem of features selection become very important in this scenario; this project will try to cast
  some light on the problem by evaluating different approaches over a reduced version of the SDSS dataset.
  
\section{Problem Formulation}
  The overall problem can be divided into to main section:\newline
  The first one is the issue of features selection, what follows is a possible formal formulation of the problem:\newline
  We start from a number of features $ M = 1000 $, the objective is to find $M' \ll M$ such that 
  the selected $M'$ features gives the smallest expected generalization error, in mathematical terms:\newline\newline
  
  \textit{Given a set of functions $y = f(x,\alpha)$ we want to find a preprocessing over the data, $\textbf{x} \mapsto (\textbf{x} * \sigma)$}
  \begin{equation}
    \tau(\sigma, \alpha) = \int \mathrm V(y,f((x*\sigma),\alpha) \,\mathrm{d}p(\textbf{x},y)
  \end{equation}
  \textit{subject to $||\sigma||_0$}
  
  The problem considered is a classical of supervised learning: multi-class classification. As described in section 4.1, 
  each sample in the dataset belong to one of ten different classes

\section{Methodology}

\section{Experiments}
  \subsection{Dataset Description}
    The dataset that has been used for this project is a reduced version of the SDSS spectroscopic dataset:
    it consisted of 4000 spectroscopic samples, each of this sample formed by 1000 features that describes 
    the spectrum over the different wavelength.\newline
    Objects in the dataset belong to 10 different categories:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{UNKNOW}: Unknown celestial objects
      \item \textbf{STAR}: Generic stellar objects
      \item \textbf{ABSORTION GALAXY}: Galaxies that show relatively homogeneous spectra, dominated by absorption features from cool giant stars
      \item \textbf{GALAXY}: Generic galaxy(neither absortion nor emission)
      \item \textbf{EMISSION GALAXY}: Galaxies whose spectrum is dominated by emission features
      \item \textbf{NARROW-LINE QSO}: Narrow emission quasars
      \item \textbf{BROAD-LINE QSO}: Broad emission quasars
      \item \textbf{SKY}: No better specified
      \item \textbf{HI-Z QSO}: Quasars with an high red-shift coefficient 
      \item \textbf{LATE-TYPE STAR}: Cooled starts(type K or type M)
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \subsubsection{Preprocessing}
    This project do not use the original SDSS dataset(which contained more than 4000 features per sample!).\newline
    The samples present in the original dataset had two main problems:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Each individual spectra present a different redshift factor(z). This phenomena is due to the fact that 
	the object that was being observed, was moving during while emitting light, this cause the frequency of light
	to `shift` toward lower energy wavelenght ie. toward `red` wavelenght.
     
     \item Missing data: There are several reasons for gaps to exist: The removal of skylines,
	bad pixels on the CCD chips all leave gaps at different frame wavelengths for each spectrum, general tecnical problem, etc. 
	All these factor can contribute to incomplete spectra.\newline
	To overcome this problem a Principal Component Anaysis(henceforth referred as PCA) is used to reproject the data
	on their principal dimension and then used to fill the missing gap. The entire procedure is described in detail in \cite{redshift}
    \end{itemize}
    In addition to the two above stated procedure the dataset has been furtherly downsample till to reduce the number of significant features
    to 1000(which is still quite high!).\newline
    Finally, given the fact that the spectra belong to very different celestial object at very different distance(light years order) from 
    the observation point, a final step of normalization is applied that is Z-Score and mean centering(making them suitable for a subsequent PCA analysis).
  
  \subsubsection{Visualization}
    In figure 2 are shown some random spectra for different type of objected extracted from the dataset:
